## CSS Z-Index and Stacking Order
- children sit on top of their parents
- HTML elements have a natural stacking order
- elements by default are position: static
- position: absolute takes elements out of HTML flow
- Z-Index by default is 0
- z-index: 1; brings the element closest to the user and farthest away from screen.
- z-index: -1; puts the element farthest away from user.
- position must be set to absolute, relative, or fixed to use the Z-Index; can't be the default static position.
